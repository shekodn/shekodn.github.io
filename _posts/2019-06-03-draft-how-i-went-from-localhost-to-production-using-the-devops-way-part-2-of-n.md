This post covers:
=================

*   The continuation of the [first post](https://medium.com/@sergiodn/how-i-went-from-localhost-to-production-using-the-devops-way-part-1-of-n-7a7b4c35515f?fbclid=IwAR20tunZ_oA5yXwbxdi1fc0Hz9wQMEnpBjnYDqSpXDIgOjpwRsofxK0PPLw) of this series
*   How Continuous Delivery integrates with Continuous Integration
*   How to deploy the latest version of our application to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk

Continuous Delivery
===================

In the previous post we focused on the setup of the Continuous Integration (CI) part of our implementation. Meaning that now we can add a new feature to our application and push a new version of it to a container repository within minutes. All of this while relying on an automated process (except for the peer review).

<img class="s t u ft ai" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2264/1*hW5FMXo0ol5gSE8gdyzflQ.png" width="1132" height="397" role="presentation"/>

Continuous Integration (Before)
</small>

Now we want to be able to send our application from Docker Hub to production in a safe, quick and sustainable way.

> Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. A pillar of [modern application development](https://aws.amazon.com/modern-apps/), continuous delivery expands upon [continuous integration](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/) by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage [1].

As a result, developers will always have the next release available. One that went through a code review and that has passed through a standardized testing process.

Adding CD to our current implementation would look something like this:

Gameplan
========

To do this, we are going to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our cloud provider, so make sure you have an AWS account. We are also going to use Elastic Beanstalk (EB). The latter is a Platform-As-A-Service that allows developers to easily leverage on AWS for application deployment and management.

Architecture
============

Since _trendlit_ has a very simple architecture, using an EC2 instance and Application Load Balancer should be more than enough.

<img class="s t u ft ai" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/680/1*eLhgeRWN-XOzK88HuHjA_Q.png" width="340" height="142" role="presentation"/>

2-Tier Architecture

**EC2**
-------

> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers [2].

Application Load Balancer
-------------------------

> Application Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers [3].

Configure access to AWS
=======================

We are going to setup an application and environment using EB. This will be done by using the AWS command line tool. If you are a macOS user install it using homebrew, otherwise you can also use pip:

```
sudo pip install U awscli
```

Setting up AWS in our host machine
----------------------------------

Credentials
-----------

We need to make sure that we have the _credentials_ file in the following path: _$HOME/.aws/credentials_

```
[default]  
aws_access_key_id = SECRET  
aws_secret_access_key = SECRET
```

If you don’t know how to get your keys you can click [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21440709/how-do-i-get-aws-access-key-id-for-amazon).

Region
------

We need to make sure that we have the config file in the following path: _$HOME/.aws/config_

```
[default]  
region=us-west-2
```

If you want to make sure to use the closest AWS region to you, go to [https://www.cloudping.info/](https://www.cloudping.info/). Otherwise you can always use the default one which is _us-west-2._

Create an EB Application
========================

An EB application is like a project folder that will allow us to organize our components. So if we have a project named _trendlit_, we will name our EB application as _trendlit_.

```
aws elasticbeanstalk create-application --application-name trendlit --description "trendlit application"
```

Retrieve the name of the latest Docker EB stack available
---------------------------------------------------------

Since we are going to run a docker container in our EC2 instance, we can take advantage of the stack that it is offered straight out by the box by AWS. We can get the name by running:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk list-available-solution-stacks | grep Docker | head -1 | sed ‘s/,//g’ | sed ‘s/ //g’
```

Sample output
-------------

```
“64bitAmazonLinux2018.03v2.12.11runningDocker18.06.1-ce”
```

Since we are working with JSON data, what about introducing _jq_ here?

> jq is like sed for JSON data — you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.

If you are a macOS user install it using homebrew, otherwise you can see how to install jq [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

After, we can run the following command to get something cleaner:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk list-available-solution-stacks | grep Docker | head -1 | sed ‘s/\,//g’ | sed ‘s/ //g’
```

Sample output
-------------

```
# Keep the result in your notepad, because we will use it later.  
64bit Amazon Linux 2018.03 v2.12.11 running Docker 18.06.1-ce
```

**Create an EB environment**
============================

An application can have several environments such as development, staging, and production. For this example we will create only one environment inside the application we just created. Doing this, will allow us to run the application container that is waiting for us in Docker Hub.

```
aws elasticbeanstalk create-environment --application-name trendlit --environment-name trendlit-production --description "trendlit's production environment" --solution-stack-name "64bit Amazon Linux 2018.03 v2.12.11 running Docker 18.06.1-ce" --tier "Name=WebServer,Type=Standard,Version=''"
```

By running the previous command, we create an environment inside _trendlit_ application called _trendlit-production_. Here, we also specify to use the AWS Docker stack that we just got in the last step.

**Retrieving the public endpoint**
==================================

After creating the environment, we can retrieve the public hostname of the EB load balancer. In order to do it we can use the following command:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environments --environment-name trendlit-production | jq -r '.Environments[0]'.CNAME
```

Sample Output
-------------

If you get _null,_ just wait a minute or so and you should be able to eventually get the public endpoint:

```
trendlit-production.txegsnm9ba.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

This means that we should be able to [_curl_](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/curl.htm) it:

```
curl -I trendlit-production.txegsnm9ba.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

If everything went well, you can go to your AWS online console and go to the respective EB section. After making sure that you are in the region, you specified earlier, you should see something like this:

And if you go to the respective application URL and you can see “Congratulations” we are golden.

**Deploying The Container In Our Environment**
==============================================

Our infrastructure is now set, but we still need run our Docker container in it. So we are going to use this config file in order to configure our running server.

</small class="img-caption">


**Uploading the Application Configuration to S3**
=================================================

We need to save the application configuration in our infrastructure so EB can easily retrieve it. So what about using an AWS S3 Bucket?

> An Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), an object storage offering [4].

First, we need to create an S3 with a **unique** identifier

```
# This is a suggested name, but feel free to use whatever you want.  
aws s3 mb s3://trendlit-YOURNAME
```

Now that we have our S3 Bucket, we can copy the _trendlit-latest.json_ file into it.

```
aws s3 cp trendlit-latest.json s3://trendlit-YOURNAME/
```

**Assigning the application configuration to the EB environment**
=================================================================

Now that our configuration lives inside our infrastructure we can tell EB to deploy a specific version.

```
aws elasticbeanstalk create-application-version --application-name "trendlit" --version-label trendlit-latest --description "This config will always pull the latest tag from Docker Hub" --source-bundle "S3Bucket=trendlit, S3Key=trendlit-latest.json"
```

**Deploy the application configuration to the respective EB environment**
=========================================================================

In order to tell AWS to update the EC2 instance where our application is running, we need to do the following:

First, we need to get _EnvironmentId_ so we can update that specific environment.

```
aws elasticbeanstalk describe-environments --environment-names trendlit-production | jq -r '.Environments[0].EnvironmentId'
```

**Sample Output**

```
# Keep the result in your notepad, we will use it later.  
e-12345678
```

Then we can proceed to update the desired environment by running:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --application-name trendlit --environment-id e-12345678 --version-label trendlit-latest
```

After the update completes successfully, we should be able to see your application up and running.

Wrapping it up
==============

For now, we have an automated process that tests our application, pushes it to a container repository, and updates the latest version of the application with single command. Although it might seem we finished the proposed implementation, there is still a lot of work that can be done. We must be aware that we neglected a lot of important aspects such as the _least privilege principle_ in order to go from Localhost to Production. The next version should be focused on balancing the security risks while keeping up the implementation advancement.

Some things that we could also address in the next release are things like having a rollback strategy. In other words, we could add a step to the pipeline’s workflow for uploading the configuration file with the respective release version. So if there is a problem with a release, we can always select the previous version and roll it back with a single command:

```
aws elasticbeanstalk update-environment --application-name trendlit --environment-id e-12345678 --version-label trendlit-X.X.X
```

If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them. I’m pretty sure we can include them in future roadmaps. BTW, _Pull Requests_ are open ;) so I would like to collaborate with you if you think we can improve the process. In the meantime, I will be working on part 3.
